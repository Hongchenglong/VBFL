# VBFL (emulation)

## Introduction
VBFL is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain-based Federated Learning framework with a validation scheme robust against the distorted local model updates. This repo hosts an emulated implementation for VBFL written in Python.

Please refer to [*Robust Blockchained Federated Learning with Model Validation and Proof-of-Stake Inspired Consensus*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03300) for detailed explanations of the mechanisms.

## Instructions to run
**environments**
```
python 3.7.6
pytorch 1.4.0
```
**Suggested Running Steps**

(1)Clone the repo
```
$ git clone 
```
